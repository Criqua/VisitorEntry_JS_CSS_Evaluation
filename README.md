# Practice project for the Web Design and E-Commerce course.

This project consists of developing a responsive web page that allows the registration of visitor information through an interactive form. The entire interface was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, based on specific functional requirements provided by the course instructor. The form allow users to enter details such as a Nicaraguan national ID number, first and last names, the department visited, and the reason for the visit. Each field is subject to validation, including regular expressions and other constraints, to ensure that the information collected is, in fact, useful and consistent.

The records are stored locally in the browser and displayed in a dynamic table, allowing data to persist without reloading the page or requiring a serverâ€”serving as a conceptual scenario. This approach provides a solid foundation for more complex projects focused on visitor management in physical locations or events.
